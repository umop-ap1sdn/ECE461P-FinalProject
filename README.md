# Code Reuse #
The only bit of code reused in this case was the indicator calculation for ADX and ATR from https://technical-analysis-library-in-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ta.html#trend-indicators.
ADX was modified from their source code to suit the project's needs. Otherwise, all code was produced for the project.
